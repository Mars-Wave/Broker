Brokers are miserable people that are wasting their life's energy paying attention to numbers and statistics. 

You start the game being one of these brokers, you compete with a player pool (NPC's and maybe players) and you either die miserable,
are so miserable you have to quit trading, go bankrupt or wind up the last broker, in which case you have nothing to be proud of since 
all you did is earn money at the expense of others and yourself.
