User U begins the game.

He is a broker and chooses a name for him/herself, he appears home at 8:00. U goes to the office and starts trading looking for 
some profit. U realises that time flew by at work and that he's mentally tired and hungry. U goes home.
U has dinner and goes to sleep. The next day he has breakfast and goes to the office promptly to cash in some profits
with the assets U invested in the day before. U does this for a few days and scores some good deals, but U realises his life is miserable.
U goes to the park, where he gets all the more depressed. U then is left with no choice by his mental state than to kill himself.
