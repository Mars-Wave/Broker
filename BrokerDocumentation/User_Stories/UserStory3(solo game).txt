User U begins the game.

U is a broker and chooses a name for him/herself, he appears home at 8:00. U only cares about trading and making money so U just trades through the day 
and night. Eventually U realises that he cannot keep going like that. U tries going home and taking care of his mental health but U also has to eat
and take care of his physique so he has to be interalised in the nearest hospital. 

Then the game is over.

- The medics confuse him for another and give him a sex change operation that fails and kills him.
- U's condition only gets worse because the treatment backfires and eventually dies.
- U gets fired from the office because the firm refuses to pay the medical bills.
