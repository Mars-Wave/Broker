User U begins the game.

U is a broker and chooses a name for him/herself, he appears home at 8:00. U is a good broker and lives a good life, he invests wisely and pays
close attention to every market move and the state of it. Other brokers in the game start dying, quitting or going bankrupt. Eventually
through perseverance and a process as bland as eating pure oat grains U winds up the last broker in the game, with a big influence on the market
and an empty, lonely heart. U wins, but at what cost.
